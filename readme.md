# This repo consists of multiple problems and topics which I learned during my preparation for the technical interview.

# To be able to use it do following:
  * clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/istotaD503/interview-prep.git`
  * use your CLI to install dependencies `npm install`
  * to run all tests `npm test`. Jest will run all the tests and watch for changes.
  * to run a specific test run `npm test 'path-to-the-file'`, 
        example: `npm test sorting algorithms/bubble-sort.test.js`
